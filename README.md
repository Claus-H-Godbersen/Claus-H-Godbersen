- 👋 Hi, I’m @Claus-H-Godbersen from Kiel, Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in how Github works after having only visited it many times.
- 🌱 I’m always using some of my spare time to learn some aspects of maths or computer science. These days it's mostly Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Linux-related projects maybe.
- 📫 Feel free to send me a message: cgodbersen@posteo.de
